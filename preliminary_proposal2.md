# Capstone-Project2
# High level description of project.
    This specific data source is rather interesting. I was interested in using biological data, like gene variants, to predict illness or disease, but most datasets do not have any patient information associated with gene data, because gene data is naturally identifying. Here, George Church asked people to volunteer their DNA information (usually obtained from online sources like 23andMe) and their health information to the cause of science.

#What question or problem are you trying to solve?

    I would like to see if any gene variants are associated with increased risk of some disease. There are about 2000 genomes in the Personal Genome Project which I could look at. 
    
#How will you present your work?

    Maybe a web app, or just slides. 
#What are your data sources?
    The Harvard Personal Genome Project.
#Whatâ€™s your next step towards making this your project.
