# Capstone-Project2
# High level description of project.

    The Library of Integrated Network-based Cell Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH funded project where cells are methodically subjected to assays with different promising medical compounds, and changes in gene expression, protein expression are recorded. My project idea here is rather simple: For some diseases, like Alzheimer's, find through some other source the gene expression changes in an Alzheimer's Disease brain. Then, look through the molecules in the LINCS database to find one which most strongly pushes in the opposite direction, i.e., its genetic signature is opposite to that of Alzheimer's.

# What question or problem are you trying to solve?
    I am trying to use the LINCS database to identify promising molecules for diseases.
#How will you present your work?

    I would like to visualize the genetic microarray data, which will probably be analyzed through PCA, in 3D graphs. In one graph we would see the results from a baseline sample, then the AD sample, then the drug treatment sample, showing that it went the other way. I would like to make this interactive, not sure how. Maybe as one of those fancy shmancy new school websites, where you scroll down and see the results of the PCA analysis, with a pretty black background with stars and stuff.
#What are your data sources?
